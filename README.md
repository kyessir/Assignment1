NewJeans is a popular girl group rising aorund the world. My purpose for this revamp of their website (https://newjeans.kr/) is to allow newcommers and fans to understand and gain more knowledge about them, and also allow the group to garner more sales through the purchase of albums and merch. 

## Design Process
 
I designed this website with the focus for users to have a seemless and smooth experience and get wanted information from the website.

As a new fan, I want to search information about the members and learn more about them. The orginal website does not offer information about them though.

As a fan wanting to spend momey on their merch and albums, I want to buy their items offically. However, the original website does not offer a shop selling such items and the offical shop is located on another website.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

## Features

These are some features I implemented inside my website.
- Provide links to external resources, such as the band's social media profiles.
- Micro interactions when interacting with the site eg, clicking on an interactable area to show some animation, mouse over interactions, scrolling interactions when interacting with the site.
- A product listing page showcasing all information about various items sold.
- Add to Cart function that seemlessly adds selected items to the Cart.
- A checkout feature that showcases total quantity and price of the purchase for payment. Actual payment using money is not implemented for this project.

### Features Left to Implement
- Showcase photos, audio and/or video clips from the band's catalogue.
- Publicise the band's upcoming shows and/or availability to perform at events such as weddings and corporate parties.
- Product description of the item in the shop page.
- Filter function for the shop page.

## Technologies Used
 I used languages like vanilla JavaScript (JS), HTML and CSS for my project. 

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** library to simplify DOM manipulation.
