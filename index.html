            <p>NewJeans (뉴진스) is a girl group by ADOR and HYBE Labels, consisting of 5 members; 
            Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein. The name 'NewJeans' is a word play. 
            It alludes to the idea that jeans are a timeless fashion item and the group's 
            intention to carve a timeless image for themselves. The name is also a word play on 
            the phrase "new genes", referring to the group ushering a new generation of pop music! </p>
